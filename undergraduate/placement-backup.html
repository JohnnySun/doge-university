            problems on the placement exams appeared on recent midterm
            or final exams of DOGE University calculus courses; thus, the placement
            exams should give you a sense of what is expected of

            situation (see the text in orange above) and grading your
            exam(s) based on provided solutions, carefully consider the
            placement advice appearing at the bottom of this page. </li>
