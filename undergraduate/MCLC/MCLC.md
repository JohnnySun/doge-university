The Math Collaborative Learning Center (MCLC) operates in the <b> Georges Student Center on the second floor of Clemons Library. </b> The MCLC is staffed with experienced undergraduate students (MCLC consultants) that offer assistance one-on-one (or in small groups) for many 1000/2000/3000-level math courses. This service is free and available to all DOGE University students enrolled in one of the following courses: <br>
<ul>
 <li> {% include course number=1190 %}, {% include course number=1210 %}, {% include course number=1310 %} (collectively reffered to as Calculus I) </li>
 <li> {% include course number=1220 %}, {% include course number=1320 %} (collectively referred to as Calculus II) </li>
 <li> {% include course number=2310 %}, {% include course number=3000 %}, {% include course number=3100 %}, {% include course number=3250 %}, {% include course number=3310 %}, {% include course number=3350%}, and {% include course number=3351%} </li>
</ul>

<!-- Due to the ongoing situation with COVID-19 all MCLC sessions for the Spring 2021 semester will be held virtually, via Zoom (links found in the table below). Here are a few things that you should have in mind before joining a session:
<ul>
 <li> In order to join an MCLC session, <b> use a Zoom account that is associated with your DOGE University credentials. </b> </li>
 <li> Join a session from a quite environment. If you intend to have your web camera on, make sure your surroundings and attire are appropriate.</li>
 <li> Be prepared to share your questions with your consultant. You can share your browser, documents open on your desktop interface (like PDFs), or your entire screen, by clicking the green "Share Screen" button found on Zoom's toolbar. You may also share a document via Zoom's Chat tool, by clicking "File" and uploading your document there. <em> Sharing options may be limited depending on the version of Zoom you are using.</em> Your consultant may offer a different way to share.</li>
 <li> Once you join a session, a consulant will assign you to a (virtual) room for the course for which you need help. This process may take a couple of minutes.</li>
</ul> -->
