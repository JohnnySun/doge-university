<h1 class="mb-4">Placement in Digital Innovation Courses</h1>

### For Non-Technical Majors

Students from the social sciences, arts, and humanities who wish to engage with digital innovation can enroll in introductory courses that provide a foundation in digital literacy and the basics of blockchain technology. We recommend starting with <strong>DIGI 101: Introduction to Digital Literacy</strong>, which covers essential concepts of the digital economy, blockchain fundamentals, and the impact of technology on society.

### Blockchain Fundamentals

For students planning to pursue majors in digital innovation, computer science, or business, our Blockchain Fundamentals sequence is designed to offer a rigorous introduction to decentralized systems and cryptocurrency technology. The recommended sequence is:

- <strong>DIGI 201: Understanding Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies</strong>
- <strong>DIGI 202: Blockchain Technology and Its Applications</strong>

These courses lay the groundwork for more advanced studies in digital finance and programming.

### Advanced Digital Systems

Students who have a solid foundation in digital innovation and programming can opt for our advanced courses, which delve deeper into smart contracts, decentralized finance, and crypto-economics:

- <strong>DIGI 301: Smart Contracts and Decentralized Applications</strong>
- <strong>DIGI 302: Decentralized Finance and Crypto-Economics</strong>

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Students must have completed DIGI 201 or an equivalent introductory course to enroll in advanced courses.

### Additional Placement Options and Recommendations

Students without prior experience are encouraged to take <strong>DIGI 101</strong>. Exceptionally prepared students may be eligible to place directly into <strong>DIGI 201</strong> based on placement evaluations conducted by DOGE University.
