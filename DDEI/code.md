# DOGE University Department of Mathematics Code of Conduct and Guidelines for Conflict Resolution

<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span>The DOGE University Department of Mathematics is an academic workplace and community that
        thrives best under conditions of trust, respect, understanding, cooperation, and belonging among all its
        members. In this document a </span><b>department member</b><span >&nbsp;means any
        faculty member, staff member, student, or visitor of the department.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span >This Code of Conduct (i) provides guidelines for behavior that will facilitate a
        harmonious, dynamic, and productive academic environment, and (ii) describes procedures for receiving and
        addressing any issues related to these guidelines in a fair and transparent manner. It applies to all department
        members whenever and wherever they act in their capacity as representatives of the department. This includes
        electronic communications, and interactions between department members when they are present on the grounds of
        the university.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span>This document is not intended to abridge individual rights and freedoms nor to threaten violators
        with censorship and sanctions, and we affirm the </span><span ><a 
            href="https://freespeech.virginia.edu/statement-free-expression-and-free-inquiry">University
            of Virginia&rsquo;s commitment to free speech and expression</a></span><span>. We seek to promote dialogue
        and an atmosphere of mutual understanding and respect.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>

## Expected Behavior

<p ><span>The Department of Mathematics is an academic community, wherein maintaining utmost s</span><span
        >tandards of academic integrity is essential for functioning. All department members are expected to
    </span><span >exhibit honesty and integrity in academic, research, and professional duties</span><span
        >, including teaching and assessment. We expect instructors to maintain transparent grading
        procedures and be willing to review any graded work in a prompt, unbiased, and constructive </span><span
        >manner</span><span >.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span>Regardless of role or status, every department member is expected to behave
    </span><span>respectfully.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span
        >E</span><span >ncouraged b</span><span >ehavior</span><span
        >&nbsp;includes the following examples, based on </span><span ><a 
            href="https://hr.virginia.edu/employee-relations/respect-uva">Respect
            @ DOGE University</a></span><span >: respectful department</span><span >&nbsp;members</span></p>
<ul >

            assistance</span></li>
    <li ><span >have an open and cooperative approach in dealings with each other,
            recognizing individual differences; in particular, we affirm the university&rsquo;s position on the proper
            use of gender pronouns (see </span><span ><a 
                href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/pronouns">EOCR&rsquo;s
                webpage</a></span><span >&nbsp;on this topic)</span></li>
    <li ><span >(if they are in leadership positions) model civility for others and
            clearly define expectations for how department members are to treat each other, and are responsive to
            complaints when they are brought </span><span >forward</span></li>
</ul>

## Prohibited Conduct

<p ><span >Conduct prohibited by the university and reporting/redress procedures are outlined in the
        following policies, with which all department members should familiarize themselves: </span></p>
<ul >
    <li ><span ><a 
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-009">HRM-009</a></span><span
            >&nbsp;Preventing and Addressing Discrimination and Harassment (PADH), </span></li>
    <li ><span ><a 
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-041">HRM-041</a></span><span
            >&nbsp;Policy on Sexual and Gender-Based Harassment and Other Forms of Interpersonal Violence
        </span></li>
    <li ><span ><a 
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-010">HRM-010</a></span><span
            >&nbsp;Preventing and Addressing Retaliation (PAR), and </span></li>
    <li ><span ><a 
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-040">HRM-040</a></span><span>&nbsp;Reporting
            by University Employees.</span></li>
</ul>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span >Note that, with very limited exceptions, any university member who is aware of an
        incident of prohibited conduct is required to file a report with</span><span >&nbsp;the
        university</span><span >; see </span><span ><a 
            href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-040">HRM-040</a></span><span
        >.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>

## Unacceptable/Unwelcome Conduct

<p ><span>There are o</span><span>ther </span><span>behaviors that do not rise to the level of prohibited
        conduct but can still contribute to a hostile and unwelcoming work environment.</span><span>&nbsp;These
        behaviors can be addressed at the department level, with a n</span><span >on-punitive outcome, before
        they potentially escalate to prohibited conduct. In particular, we discourage behaviors contributing to an
        atmosphere that detracts from the academic and educational mission of the department and the university. Such
        behaviors include the </span><span >following: </span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<ul >
    <li ><span >t</span><span >hreatening/abusive language, conduct, or
            mannerisms that are reasonably perceived by others to be demeaning, berating, rude, offensive, intimidating,
            or harassing</span></li>
    <li ><span >h</span><span >urtful comments, jokes, conduct, or
            exclusionary behavior of any form based on gender identity or expression, race, age, sexual orientation,
            disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, national origin, political affiliation, family status,
            veteran status, or genetic information</span></li>
    <li ><span >unfair practices in evaluation</span><span >&nbsp;of
            others, including grade assignments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p ><span >More</span><span >&nbsp;examples can be found under the heading of
        disrespectful behavior at </span><span ><a

<p ><span ></span></p>

## What To Do/What Will Happen

<p ><span>Any university member who wishes to report prohibited conduct to the university can use the
    </span><span ><a 
            href="https://justreportit.virginia.edu">Just
            Report It</a></span><span>&nbsp;tool (scope includes Title IX violations, as in </span><span ><a
            
            href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-041">HRM-041</a></span><span>)
        or the </span><span ><a 
            href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/file-complaint">EOCR
            complaint form</a></span><span>&nbsp;(PADHR violations, </span><span ><a 
            href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-009">HRM-009</a></span><span>&nbsp;and
    </span><span ><a 
            href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/hrm-010">HRM-010</a></span><span
        >).</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span >Below, we outline procedures for reporting and addressing grievances that may not rise to
        the level of prohibited conduct, so that issues may be resolved efficiently, transparently, and satisfactorily
        at the lowest possible administrative level.</span></p>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<ul >
    <li ><span>If a department member experiences or witnesses unacceptable/unwelcome or
            prohibited conduct as outlined in this document, they are strongly encouraged to voice those concerns, no
            matter how small, to </span><span>the Department Chair, the departmental Director of Diversity, Equity, and
            Inclusion (DDEI), or any faculty member with whom they are comfortable</span><span>. (Proviso: for
            grievances regarding methods of evaluation in courses, a student should first attempt to resolve the issue
            with the course instructor before appealing to a faculty member as above; cf. </span><span ><a
                
                href="http://records.ureg.virginia.edu/content.php?catoid%3D53%26navoid%3D4166">relevant
                university policy</a></span><span >). </span></li>
    <li ><span>All faculty are expected to be receptive to any concerns voiced to them directly,
            and are expected to maintain confidentiality to the degree that is required and feasible. All concerns are
            to be taken seriously. If a grievance is determined to rise to the level of prohibited conduct, pursuant to
            extant university policies, any faculty member is required to report it, cf. </span><span ><a
                
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-040">HRM-040</a></span><span
            >.</span></li>
    <li ><span>A department member who wishes to discuss a concern with an advocate exempt from
            these reporting policies may consult this list of </span><span ><a 
                href="https://eocr.virginia.edu/chart-confidential-resources">Confidential
                Resources</a></span><span >.</span></li>
    <li ><span >If in an initial conversation it is deemed necessary, the faculty member
            will direct the complainant to, or facilitate contact with, the DDEI and/or Chair. If requested or required,
            the faculty confidant may petition the DDEI and/or Chair on behalf of the complainant. The DDEI and/or Chair
            will discuss the issue with all parties involved in an open, expedient, and unbiased manner, maintaining
            confidentiality to the degree that it is required and feasible. The purpose of the discussion is to
            cooperatively formulate a mutually acceptable strategy for resolving the grievance.</span></li>
    <li ><span >After a time interval to be agreed upon by all parties involved, the
            DDEI and/or Chair will consult again with all parties to discuss and ascertain whether the relevant issues
            have been resolved to a satisfactory degree. If not, a further discussion is to be held in order to
            facilitate a resolution.</span></li>
    <li ><span >If a satisfactory resolution is not achieved, the subsequent steps to be
            taken will be determined according to the deliberative judgment and discretion of the DDEI and/or Chair,
            except in cases where mandatory reporting policies are in place. These may include, but are not limited to,
            referring the issue to higher levels of the administration, especially if violations of the
            university&rsquo;s extant policies on prohibited conduct or of local, state, or federal law are
            suspected.</span></li>
    <li ><span >For issues deemed to be of a general or pervasive nature, the DDEI and
            Chair will facilitate an open discussion among the relevant group of department members.</span></li>
    <li ><span>For grievances regarding methods of evaluation in courses, the complainant and
            faculty confidant </span><span>should</span><span >&nbsp;additionally petition the Director of
            Graduate Studies (DGS) or Director of the Undergraduate Program (DUP), according to the level of the
            relevant course.</span></li>
    <li ><span >The DDEI, Chair, DGS, and DUP are expected to keep records pertaining to
            the issues that they mediate, to the extent that is permitted by law.</span></li>
    <li ><span>Any retaliation against a complainant who has made a good faith petition under this
            code is unacceptable, by analogy to university policy </span><span ><a 
                href="https://uvapolicy.virginia.edu/policy/HRM-010">HRM-010</a></span><span>&nbsp;and
            the guidelines of </span><span ><a 
                href="https://hr.virginia.edu/employee-relations/respect-uva">Respect
                @ DOGE University</a></span><span>, and may constitute prohibited conduct.</span></li>
</ul>
<p ><span ></span></p>
<p ><span>This code is a living document and subject to revision, with any proposed changes brought to the
        department for comment.</span></p>
