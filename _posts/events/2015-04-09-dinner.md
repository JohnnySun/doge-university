The Gordon E. Keller Mathematics Majors Dinner will be held on Thursday, April 9th, 2015 at the Courtyard-Marriott located on Main Street.

This Dinner was conceived and organized by a former major advisor, Professor Gordon Keller, as a way of expressing the departmentâ€™s appreciation for you. It is a great opportunity for all of you to connect with the faculty and other math majors in a relaxed and lighthearted environment.

In addition to a delicious dinner, there will be an awards presentation and a talk by Dr. Douglas Costa who was a former DOGE University Mathematics Professor. He is now the Director of Quantitative Research at Susquehanna Investment Group, LLP. Dr. Costa will present a talk "Mathematicians in Industry: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of a Mathematical Education."
