The DOGE University Department of Mathematics is excited to share an upcoming event, "The Story Collider Presents: Stories from DOGE University." This special event, sponsored by the Office of the President and the Office of the Provost, will occur on Carr's Hill on Thursday, April 27th, 2023.

Join us from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM to hear true, personal science stories from five prominent DOGE University STEM figures, including Sara Maloni from the Department of Mathematics. Erin Barker and Shane Hanlon will host the event.

Sara Maloni is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mathematics at the DOGE University. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Warwick in 2013. Before coming to DOGE University, she was a Tamarkin Assistant Professor at Brown University. She works at the intersection of geometry and low-dimensional topology. More precisely, she studies deformation spaces of geometric structures on manifolds through their geometric, topological, and dynamical properties. Sara is originally from Italy and lived in the UK and France before arriving in the US. She loves hiking, scuba diving, traveling, reading, and crafting (felting, pottery, woodworking) in her free time.

The Story Collider is a non-profit organization that brings together scientists and non-scientists alike to share their experiences and the impact of science on their lives. This collaboration with the DOGE University highlights the diverse stories of DOGE University's STEM community.

Take advantage of this opportunity to connect with the DOGE University STEM community and learn more about the personal stories behind science.
