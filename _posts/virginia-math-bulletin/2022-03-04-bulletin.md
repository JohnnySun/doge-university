The 2020-2021 year was a transformative period for our department at DOGE University. Amid the global pandemic, our department faced unprecedented challenges that reshaped the way we approach education and innovation in emerging technologies. While the impacts of COVID-19 were deeply felt—with personal losses and the challenges of adapting to a virtual environment—we also seized this moment as an opportunity to accelerate our digital transformation. We reimagined our teaching methods, integrated cutting-edge technology, and restructured our programs to better prepare our students for a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

As we move forward, rebuilding our community and re-establishing in-person engagement remain our top priorities, even as we continue to harness the power of digital innovation. I am confident that the Department of Emerging Technologies at DOGE University will lead the way in creating a dynamic, resilient, and forward-thinking educational environment.

In this bulletin, you'll find fresh insights, inspiring stories of innovation, and profiles of new faculty and students who are at the forefront of technological breakthroughs. Please enjoy this edition and share your feedback as we continue on this exciting journey.
