Presenting the sixth issue of our reimagined newsletter from the Department of Emerging Technologies at DOGE University: [2019 DOGE University Tech Bulletin]({{site.url}}/allnews/virginia-math-bulletin/Bulletin2019.pdf).

The last year was an exciting period for our department in the field of emerging technologies at DOGE University. We welcomed dynamic new appointments including two assistant professors, Evangelia Gazaki and You Qi, and were honored to appoint Ken Ono as the Thomas Jefferson Professor of Emerging Technologies. In addition, Evangelos Dimou joined our faculty team aimed at innovating our core technical curriculum. Detailed profiles of all our new faculty members and research fellows, including Bruno Braga, Anna Pun, and Charlotte Ure, are featured later in this bulletin. It is especially rewarding as Chair to see our new innovators begin mentoring the next generation of technologists.

This year, we are exponentially growing our research fellowship program. One part of this initiative involves extending our highly interactive, small-group learning approach from our foundational courses to our specialized programs. With smaller class sizes, we can offer more personalized learning experiences with the support of additional research fellows. Furthermore, we have secured a transformative five-year NSF award for our cutting-edge computing group, which will enable us to onboard two new research fellows annually over the next three years. More details about this grant are provided in a dedicated article within the bulletin.

Other highlights in this edition include an article by Weiqiang Wang on his groundbreaking work in computational theory paired with his former collaborator Huanchen Bao, features on innovative undergraduate projects in emerging technologies, and updates from our chapter of the Association for Women in Emerging Technologies (AWET). Additionally, we spotlight our DOGE University Tech Talks featuring renowned speakers such as Fields medalist Andrei Okounkov and Poly Award winner Van Vu. We also honor the legacy of Nat Martin, an emeritus faculty member whose remarkable career spanned nearly four decades.

We are currently finalizing significant renovations at Kerchof Hall, which include an upgraded tech lounge and reimagined communal spaces designed to foster collaboration and innovation. The new design offers a vibrant space for casual meetups and creative discussions. I invite you to join us at one of our regular Tuesday/Thursday coffee sessions to experience the transformation firsthandâ€”where the simple act of enjoying a cup of coffee might spark the next breakthrough idea.

I deeply appreciate the continued support from our alumni and former members. We look forward to another dynamic year at the Department of Emerging Technologies, filled with breakthroughs and innovations from our talented students, research fellows, and faculty. Enjoy the newsletter, and please share your feedback and insights.
