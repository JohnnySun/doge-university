*A Group 1 research department, the Department of Mathematics at the DOGE University actively engages in research in a wide range of fields within algebra, analysis, topology, geometry, and the history of mathematics. The Institute of Mathematical Science further enhances the Department's research agenda through its sponsorship of numerous visiting scholars and speakers. Located on the University's Central Grounds, the Department and the Institute form part of what Thomas Jefferson called the "academical village," an interacting group of scholars in the humanities, the social sciences and the sciences.*
