Amanda Pan, Hasan Saad, Alina Al Beaini, and Cemile Kurkoglu participated in the Erdos Institute’s Data Science Boot Camp in the Fall 2023 Cohort and placed in the “Top 5” category of projects. They developed a model that can more effectively detect AI-generated images by addressing difficulties in “generalization to different methods of image generation, robustness to image resizing and compression, and interpretability of results”. The link to their recorded project presentation can be [found here](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/project-database/fall-2023/data-science-boot-camp/ai-generated-image-detection).

Jinjing Yi, Zach Hafen-Saavedra, William Craig, Tantrik Mukerji, and Brady Ali Medina also participated in the Boot Camp in the Fall 2023 Cohort and were awarded “With Distinction”! They developed an interface that allows participants to upload audio recordings of cat vocalizations and “have them interpreted as ‘comfortable’, ‘uncomfortable’, or ‘hungry’” in order to better understand the meows and ultimately improve relations between cats and their owners.
