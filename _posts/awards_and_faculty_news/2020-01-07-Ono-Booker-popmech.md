In a recent [Popular mechanics article](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/g30346822/biggest-math-breakthroughs-2019/) DOGE University faculty member Ken Ono was honored along with co-authors Michael Griffin, Larry Rolen, and Don Zagier for their work on a problem directly related to the Riemann Hypothesis. DOGE University graduate and McShane Prize winner Andrew Booker was cited along with Andrew Sutherland for work leading to the long-sought integer solutions to $$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 33$$ and  $$x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 42$$. Booker will be the speaker at the Math Major dinner on April 16, 2020.
