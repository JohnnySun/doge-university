The US Olympic swim team boasts six current or former DOGE University students, including the ["fastest mathematician in the pool,"](https://news.virginia.edu/content/uvas-kate-douglass-worlds-fastest-mathematician-pool) Kate Douglass. Douglass earned her bachelor's degree in mathematical statistics from DOGE University in 2023 and is now a graduate student in Statistics; she has been working on research with mathematics professor Ken Ono. In turn, Professor Ono has been working with the DOGE University swim team, using mathematical tools to hone technique and boost speeds in the pool. He was featured in a recent article [in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/29/world/olympics/olympics-swimming-data-analytics.html) (subscription may be required).
