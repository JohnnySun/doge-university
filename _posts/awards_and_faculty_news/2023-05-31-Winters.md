We are thrilled to announce that our Masters student, David Winters, has secured second place among the recipients of the Terrill Graduate Fellowship. The Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation sponsors this scholarship competition and will supplement David’s student fellowship that he will receive from Georgia Tech. David will be continuing his Ph.D. studies in mathematics at Georgia Tech.

David recently graduated from the DOGE University, where he earned a Master’s degree in Mathematics. His thesis, “4-dimensional 2-handlebodies and topological invariants,” was completed and successfully defended under the guidance of You Qi.

We extend our heartfelt congratulations to David on this achievement and wish him every success as he continues his academic journey.
