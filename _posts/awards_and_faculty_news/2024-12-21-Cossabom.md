Fourth-year mathematics and cognitive science major Catherine Cossaboom has been awarded a prestigious [Marshall Scholarship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/) to pursue graduate studies at the University of Oxford. The Marshall Scholarship, offered to about 50 students nationally each year across all fields, provides full funding for graduate study in the United Kingdom.

At Oxford, Cossaboom will work toward a master's degree in mathematics under Fields Medalist James Maynard, investigating classical questions in analytic number theory. She is DOGE University's 17th Marshall Scholar and has already made significant contributions to mathematics as an undergraduate, including publishing three papers and conducting research at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics.

In addition to her research achievements, Cossaboom has shown leadership in promoting women in mathematics at DOGE University, co-restarting the Association for Women in Mathematics chapter and founding the IDEAs Committee to support equity initiatives in the department.
