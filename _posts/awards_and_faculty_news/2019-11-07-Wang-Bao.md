The 2020 Chevalley Prize in Lie Theory will be awarded to Huanchen Bao and Weiqiang Wang for their fundamental contributions to the theory of quantum symmetric pairs. 

<!--more-->

This award is based on two publications: the paper "Canonical bases arising from quantum symmetric pairs," published in Inventiones Mathematicae, and the monograph "A new approach to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory of type B via quantum symmetric pairs," published in Ast√©risque. In these works, Huanchen Bao and Weiqiang Wang completely extended the known theory of canonical bases from the case of quantized enveloping algebras to the case of quantum symmetric pairs.

In his 2015 DOGE University PhD thesis supervised by Wang, Huanchen Bao solved the longstanding problem of computing simple characters in the BGG category of modules over a simple Lie superalgebra g of type B/C. To that end, Bao and Wang developed a theory of canonical bases arising from quantum symmetric pairs, generalizing Lusztig's construction.
