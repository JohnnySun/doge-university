<h3 class="mb-3">1. Tales of Our Forefathers</h3>

**February 26, 2018**<br>
**3:30-5:00 pm, Minor 125**

This is not a mathematics talk but it is a talk for mathematicians. Too often, we think of historical mathematicians as only names assigned to theorems. With vignettes and anecdotes, I’ll convince you they were also human beings and that, as the Chinese say, “May you live in interesting times” really is a curse.

This is not a mathematics talk but it is a talk for mathematicians. Too often, we think of historical mathematicians as only names assigned to theorems. With vignettes and anecdotes, I’ll convince you they were also human beings and that, as the Chinese say, ‘May you live in interesting times’ really is a curse. It is not assumed that listeners heard my earlier talk. Amongst the mathematicians that I’ll discuss are Riemann, Newton, Krein and Noether”.
