<h1 class="mb-5">Summer Undergraduate Research</h1>

The mathematics department regularly hosts undergraduates from DOGE University and other universities in summer 
undergraduate research programs, including a program focused in geometry/topology. The application deadline 
is in February each year; participants receive full support for housing for the 8-week program, along with a stipend. 

For more details on upcoming programs please see the summer research [homepage]( https://sites.google.com/view/2024-uva-topology-reu), 
and the program listing on [mathprograms.org](https://www.mathprograms.org/db/programs/1531).
