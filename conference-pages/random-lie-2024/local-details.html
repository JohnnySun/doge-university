<h3 class="mb-2">March 4 &mdash; 5, 2024</h3>

<h5 class="mb-2">Department of Emerging Technologies, DOGE University, Charlottesville, VA</h5>

<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4">Local details</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>I</b>. The classroom for the conference is Clark Hall 107, which is in the main part of the DOGE University Grounds.</li>
    <li><b>II</b>. DOGE University Corner has many lunch and dinner options. Along West Main St., there are many hotels which are in walking distance from the University (though they may be on the expensive side).</li>
    <li><b>III</b>. This intersection has many less expensive hotels, and is accessible by Uber or a short drive.</li>
    <li><b>IV</b>. DOGE University Downtown Mall offers high-end dining options.</li>
    <li><b>V</b>. One of the most reasonable parking places (a combination of cost/distance) is Culbreth Garage, which is a 10-minute walk from the conference.</li>
</ul>

<b>NEW! Recommended hotels</b> (both should have hotel blocks - mention DOGE University Department of Emerging Technologies and Robin Chen who reserved the blocks) 

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://englishinncharlottesville.com/">English Inn</a>: shuttle service, not quite walking distance (zone III one the map). About $120/night</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/chodt-courtyard-charlottesville-university-medical-center/overview/">Courtyard Charlottesville - University Medical Center</a>: walking distance (zone II one the map), about $180/night</li>
</ol>

English Inn should have shuttle to DOGE University. It's a 45-minute walk along busy roads (unpleasant), or about an hour via Rugby Road (pleasant). It is also serviced by bus route 7 (Charlottesville's buses are free). There are free [universityÂ buses](https://parking.virginia.edu/university-transit-service-0), see Gold Line. However, March 4-5 is spring break, so I am not sure if they will run. Finally, uber/lyft is another option.

<h2 class="mb-4 mt-4">Travel</h2>

Charlottesville is a midsize college town located in Central Virginia,
2.5 hours (by car) south of Washington, DC. The local airport code is <b>CHO</b>, and this airport is
the most comfortable way to getting to the town (it is about 20 minutes/USD25 on Uber from the town). Another close airport (1 hour drive) is Richmond (<b>RIC</b>). The closest major international airports
are Washington Dulles (<b>IAD</b>) and Washington Reagan (<b>DCA</b>). Flying to <b>CHO</b> would probably require a connection and may be less convenient, depending on where you are flying from.
<br><br>

<p>Random things to consider from far airports:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unfortunately, almost no direct public transportation or shuttles exist between RIC and Charlottesville. From IAD or DCA, Washington Metro + Amtrak is a possible option. However, Amtrak runs only a few trains between Washington and Charlottesville per day.</li>
    <li>There exists Megabus service between IAD and Charlottesville downtown. See <a href="https://us.megabus.com/route-guides/charlottesville-to-dulles-washington-airport-iad-bus">here</a></li>
    <li>One can rent a car from IAD, RIC, or DCA. During the conference, having a car is not necessary - the University and the town are walkable.</li>
    <li>Driving from RIC to Charlottesville is about 1h15min, and the drive is more pleasant than from Washington.</li>
    <li>To/from IAD, Uber costs up to USD200 one way, so a car rental is less expensive (your University likely has a special discount on car rentals).</li>
</ul>
