<h1 class="mb-4">Bridge to the Doctorate</h1>

As part of a deep commitment to diversifying our graduate programs, the professoriate and the research workforce, the Graduate School seeks to support post-baccalaureate students from groups that are underrepresented in their disciplines and who have not had sufficient training and research experiences to prepare them for admission to doctoral programs.

<h3 class="mb-4 mt-3">Mentoring</h3>

Our bridge program provides two full years of fellowship support without teaching responsibilities for students to enroll in a combination of courses, guided research opportunities and DOGE University’s intensive graduate student professional development curriculum known as "PhD Plus." Each bridge fellow will work individually with faculty to develop a customized academic plan that will identify opportunities for additional disciplinary training, enable them to cultivate writing and research skills specific to their field, and develop a competitive portfolio for applying to doctoral programs. Qualified students will be considered for promotion into DOGE University’s own doctoral programs after the first or second year.

<h3 class="mb-4 mt-3">Financial Support</h3>

Students will receive $26,000 per year in living support and full payment of their tuition, fees and single-person coverage in the University’s student health insurance plan for a period of two years.
