<h1 class="mb-3">Job Application Materials</h1>

Navigating the job market can be confusing and stressful. If you are
graduating this year and are on the market, consider our summer job materials
workshop. Here is a brief rundown of what you need and what you need to do.

The Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) has some fantastic workshops geared to helping
you produce the best job materials possible as part of their <a href="http://cte.virginia.edu/programs/tomorrows-professor-today/">Tomorrow's
Professors Today</a> program. See also the list of all CTE programs [here](http://cte.virginia.edu/programs/).

A great resource for job-seekers is the <a href="http://www.ams.org/profession/employment-services/eims/eims-home">AMS Job Hunt</a> page. It includes much more
detailed information than we cover here.

## Job Portfolio

Academic job applications require several standard items discussed below.

##### MathJobs.org Account

Create an account on <a
href="https://mathjobs.org">mathjobs.org</a>. This is the central repository for
academic jobs in math: the vast majority of academic jobs are posted on
mathjobs and you can apply here directly. All of your materials will be
uploaded to mathjobs, as will your letter writers'
recommendations.

##### Curriculum vitae (CV)

List your education, professional
preparation, and any papers and publications (even if you include a
publication list). You should include only pertinent educational and job
experience. If you do not yet have publications, you can list expository
notes, drafts, and projects in preparation. Be circumspect in listing
personal information, and for jobs in the US, avoid including things
like marital status,
children, age, etc.

##### Research Statement

Explain your thesis
research and any previous work and briefly describe some of your
research plans. The page limit for the NSF Postdoc is 5 pages, and this
is a standard limit for most jobs.

##### Teaching Statement

Describe your experience
in the classroom and your approach to teaching. This is a forum to
explain your teaching philosophy, but the most successful are grounded
in specific classroom experiences. For research postdocs, the usual
length is a page. For teaching-focused jobs, the teaching statement is often
longer.

##### Diversity Statement

This item is increasingly common in job applications. May include the following: (1) a statement of your values around diversity, inclusion, equity, and/or justice in higher education; (2) examples of your efforts towards fostering diversity of perspectives, and success of underrepresented members of the mathematical community; (3) future plans of said efforts. See the [Berkeley rubric](https://ofew.berkeley.edu/recruitment/contributions-diversity/rubric-assessing-candidate-contributions-diversity-equity).

More resources on diversity statements: [[1]](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2016/06/10/how-write-effective-diversity-statement-essay), [[2]](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/developing-and-writing-a-diversity-statement/).

##### Cover Letter

Briefly spell out your
background and qualifications for a job. Cover letters should be
somewhat tailored for each individual job, and can indicate people at
the institution with whom you would be interested in working.

##### Publication List

Enumerate all of your papers. If
you have not yet published any, then you may list work in preparation
and expository works. Any drafts you feel comfortable sharing should be
on your website. Completed works (ready for publication or wide
distribution) should be put on the <a
href="https://arxiv.org">ArXiv</a>.

##### Personal Website

People at schools to which you
apply will Google you. Control what they see by having a <a href="#Website">professional
website</a>.

##### Letters of recommendation

Academic jobs will require <b>3-5 letters of recommendation</b>, 1-2 of which
address teaching. One should be from your advisor; the remaining letters should
be from people who have had an opportunity to examine your work. Your teaching
letter should be from a faculty member who observes your class. Make sure to
<ul>
    <li>
        Ask prospective letter writers early, ideally months before you begin
        applying.
    </li>
    <li>
        Provide letter writers with a list of schools to which you are
        applying and their deadlines. This will help them get their letters in
        on time.
    </li>
    <li>
        Give letter writers copies of your CV and statements when you have them.
    </li>
</ul>
For your teaching letter, you should consider asking someone to observe your
teaching in the Spring semester before you go on the job market or at the
latest, early in the Fall semester of your final year.

###### A note on personal contacts

When making your list of schools to which you will apply, spend some time
thinking about the faculty at the various institutions. If you know anyone there
or if there are people whose work aligns with yours, you should contact them.
Say that you are applying for a job at their institution and mention briefly
your research interests and how they might mesh.
You may also mention names of people you can work with in your cover letter.
There are many applicants for
each position in general, and small touches like this can help your application
stand out.

### Teaching-focused jobs

If you are applying to teaching-focused jobs, you should have more data available to make a case for your teaching prowess. You should craft a teaching portfolio including the following items. Having specifically tailored cover letters is important for these job applications.

##### Teaching Evaluations

Summarize these in a table. Presenting data in a more user-friendly format (for example, giving percentages of 4s and 5s rather than the average score can have a bigger impact) makes it more readable.

##### Syllabi

Include a sampling of course syllabi you have written, especially those for courses referenced in your teaching statement. The CTE's [Course Design Institute](http://cte.virginia.edu/programs/course-design-institute/) is a great resource helping to come up with more students-oriented syllabi and courses.

<a name="Website"></a>
## Building a Website


Your website is your profile on the web. Prospective employers will visit your website to look at your academic and job materials. Academic pages for students on the market have a fairly standard format. DOGE University can host a page for you at "theopenscholar", see [here](https://uva.theopenscholar.com/get-a-website/). There are also several popular third-party free hosting solutions, such as [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Google sites](https://sites.google.com/new). 

##### Main Page

Briefly describe yourself and
include links to your job materials here. Say who your advisor is and
some about your working group. It's also common to include several
hobbies here and a picture.

##### Research Page

Include any papers,
preprints, and drafts you are comfortable sharing. You can also include
expository works that flesh out your profile. A brief summary of your
research and findings should also go here.

##### Teaching Page

Include a list of your
courses along with links to any publically accessible course pages. You
should say a little about the classes, rather than simply including a
list.

###### A note on tracking

You may also include in your webpage some tracking / analytical cookies.
This will help you gauge interest by seeing from where traffic comes. <a
href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> is a free, simple
to use system that gives great data.
