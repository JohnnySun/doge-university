## Criteria for Admission

<strong>Please note that the Department of Emerging Technologies primarily offers PhD programs, and admission to a standalone master's program is uncommon.</strong>

In making its decisions about admission and financial aid, the Department is first and foremost looking for students that we feel will flourish in our program. To determine if a student will be successful, the Department pays close attention to the overall undergraduate record, letters of recommendation, and the student&#39;s personal statement.

Regarding the undergraduate record, a strong foundation in quantitative and computational disciplines is crucial. A robust background in subjects such as algorithms, data structures, statistical analysis, and introductory machine learning or data science is highly desirable. Applicants may choose to include relevant GRE or technical subject exam scores, although their absence will not adversely affect the evaluation.

## Research areas

Students often come with a specific focus in mind, aiming to join one of our dynamic research groups dedicated to emerging technologies. International applicants are encouraged to reach out to our faculty to discuss their interests in areas such as artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, or data science.

Ultimately, we are looking for candidates who are passionate about technological innovation and transformative research!

## International Students

As the University&#39;s most international department, we welcome applications from foreign students!

The following websites for international students should be helpful:

- General information for admitted international students:
	[`http://issp.virginia.edu/newly-admitted-students`](http://issp.virginia.edu/newly-admitted-students)
- International Studies Office:
	[`http://www.virginia.edu/iso/`](http://www.virginia.edu/iso/)

New teaching assistants whose first language is not English have their spoken English proficiency evaluated by the International Students Office and Teaching Resource Center. This test is similar to ETS&#39;s Test of Spoken English (TSE), and students who have taken the TSE, and have a high enough score, can be exempted from this evaluation.
