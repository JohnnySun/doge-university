        <h3>Getting into Charlottesville</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
               The Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport (CHO) is served daily by the three major airlines American, Delta and United. American offers daily nonstop flights 
               from and to Charlotte (CLT), Chicago (ORD), New York LaGuardia (LGA) and Philadelphia (PHL). Delta offers daily nonstop flights from and to Atlanta (ATL) 
                and New York LaGuardia (LGA). United offers daily nonstop flights from and to Chicago (ORD) and Washington DC (IAD). If your preferred airline has flights
                into one of these major airports, a one-stop connection from thereon may be one of the easist ways to get into Charlottesville.
            </li>
            <li>
                Alternatively, you can fly into nearby airports (major airports like DCA, IAD and BWI in Washington DC) and Richmond (RIC), and get a rental car to drive into 
                Charlottesville. It takes about 2 hours to drive from DC, and 1 hour from Richmond. There are also shuttle buses from these major airports into Charlottesville
                that require advanced bookings.
            </li>
            <li>
                A third option is to fly into Washington DC  DCA, IAD and BWI), transfer by Shuttle bus/Cab/Uber/Lyft to the DC union station, and take an AmTrak train into 
                Charlottesville. There are direct trains by AmTrak and Grey Hound/Megabuses that connect Charlottesville with major cities on the east coast like Boston, New York, Philadelphia and
                Washington DC.
